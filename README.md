# actions-playground

This repo uses GitHub Actions to [test on pull requests](https://github.com/Blackbaud-BobbyEarl/actions-playground/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml) as well as [build and publish on pushes](https://github.com/Blackbaud-BobbyEarl/actions-playground/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml) a SKY UX Single Page Application.

The built SPA uses GitHub Pages and is available at https://blackbaud-bobbyearl.github.io/actions-playground/.

The techniques used here could easily be adjusted for a generic Angular SPA as well.
